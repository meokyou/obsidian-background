# Obsidian Background(s)

This is still the basic sample plugin, however I do have a semblance of how you would go about implementing thisâ€”just a little bit more time!

## Intended functionality

- This plugin will allow an independent workspace background image (specified by user);
- Let the user control the blur of an image; and
- Manage the transparency of the image.
